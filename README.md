# myBib: My simple bibliography manager

I wanted to learn the python webframework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) by creating a very simple bibliography manger for myself. I have borrowed a lot of code from the Udacity course [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud088) as a starting point.

This is work in progress. But it is fun.
